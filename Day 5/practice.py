"""Average Height Exercise"""


# You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.

# e.g. student_heights = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]


### CODE ###

# # ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡

"""Highest Score Exercise"""

# You are going to write a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores.

# e.g. student_scores = [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]

# Important you are not allowed to use the max or min functions. The output words must match the example. i.e

# The highest score in the class is: x

"""Adding Evens Exercise"""

# You are going to write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to 100. 
# Thus, the first even number would be 2 and the last one is 100:

# i.e. 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 +10 ... + 98 + 100

# #Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡

"""Fizz Buzz Exercise"""

# You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game.

# Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.

# When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".

# `When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".`

#   `And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"`


### CODE ###

# # Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡

# for i in range(1, 101):
#     if (i % 3 == 0) and (i % 5 == 0):
#         print("FizzBuzz")
